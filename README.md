# "CRUD" Front-End App using "React-router"
CRUD app with contacts, using react-router (action/loader).
There are some my own useful react-hooks: `useInput`, `useKeyDown`, `useTitle`.
Server pending is simulated by assets/api.js (little timeout before response).
Used `localforage` for data saving.
Based on **Vite + React (Without TS)**
## Technologies stack:
* react
* vite
* react-router
* localforage
* match-sorter
* sort-by
